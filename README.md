# SnorLabs
SnorLabs uses a 'dynamic' sleep alarm that  lets you set how many hours of sleep you would like, and starts a countdown timer when it registers that you’ve fallen asleep. 
SnorLabs will pause the timer when you wake up, and the alarm will only go off once you’ve registered 8 hours sleep.

SnorLabs uses the android sleep apk to get a sleep confidence score. Depending on the score, the countdown timer will start, pause or resume.
